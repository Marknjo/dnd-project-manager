# TaskFlowPro Drag and Drop Kanban App

The Application allows a user to add a new project activity to the activities panels.

User can the drag the activity across panels i.e. from activity to In Progress or finished to stalled stage.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Typescript
- Vite

This app was a simple demonstration of how to use Typescript in a project. That is, instead of using vanilla JavaScript, you convert the whole project to a Typescript based.

It uses loads of Class based patterns like Singleton and abstract classes.

When it comes to HTML, it takes advantage of shadow DOM by using templates to grab various pieces of elements. In this case, components.

The drag and drop feature used vanilla JavaScript Drag and Drop API. No third party libraries.

The whole project uses Vite for bundling. It is fast and simple or per say if you want it, you can make it complex as possible.

## Final Remarks

The project can extend to a whole project management app or tasks app. I intend to expand it in that direction, by even adding a backend support of data.

For now, I enjoyed the project.
